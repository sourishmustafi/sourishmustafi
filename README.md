I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Shiv Nadar University, where my research centers on development and health economics. My academic endeavors have cultivated a strong interest in developmental economics, particularly in understanding the impact of structural inequalities, such as caste discrimination, on economic outcomes.
I possess robust analytical skills, utilizing Stata for data analysis and econometric modeling. 
My primary research focus lies in exploring socioeconomic issues through the lens of development economics, with an emphasis on social justice and equity. I am keen to contribute to the existing body of literature by addressing complex economic phenomena and offering novel insights into policy implications.
